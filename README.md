Scriptipy
=========

After installing a UNIX based distribution, one often needs to install some packages and tweak sonme configurations to make it really functionnal.

This process, done manually, can be a little cumbersome. Thus, after a while, scripting the post-installation treatment is an excellent solution.

However, without any knowledge of shell command lines, this process can get pretty tricky. This is where Scriptipy gets involved. It is a post-installation script aiming to simplify this process. It works like a DBMS, but for shell.
